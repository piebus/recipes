    <ol class="mylist">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line a large baking
            sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomatoes cut side up on the baking sheet,
            drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
            Roast for 1 hour, or until the edges just start to shrivel and the insides are still juicy.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
            Add the onions, carrots, garlic, dried basil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until soft,
            about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, vegetable broth, vinegar, and thyme leaves and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool slightly and blend with an immersion blender.
            Blend until smooth.
            Add the fresh basil and pulse until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Season to taste, ladle into bowls, and garnish with fresh basil leaves and sour cream.</li>
